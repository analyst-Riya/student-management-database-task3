# Student Management Database – Task 3

This project is part of my internship at Main Crafts Technology .  
In Task 3, I worked on **advanced SQL queries** using existing tables: Students, Courses, and Enrollments.

## 📘 Task Overview
- Wrote **JOIN queries** to combine multiple tables  
- Used **GROUP BY** to summarize data  
- Applied **HAVING** to filter aggregated results  
- Focused on analyzing student and course data without adding new tables

## 🧩 Features
- Inner and Outer JOIN queries  
- Aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)  
- Data analysis using GROUP BY and HAVING clauses  
- Reports for course-wise enrollment, student performance, and more  

## 🗂️ Files Included
- [StudentManagement_Task3_Riya_Kumar.sql](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23123721/StudentManagement_Task3_Riya_Kumar.sql) — SQL script with all queries  
- `README.md` — project documentation  

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Open your SQL environment (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)  
2. Make sure your **existing database** from Task 1 or Task 2 is ready  
3. Run the SQL file:
